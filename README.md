## Spring Boot + Thymeleaf + Redis + Heroku 
This demo application has been created as an example of deploying Spring Boot + Thymeleaf + Redis on Heroku.

### Technology Stack
- Spring Boot, no-xml Spring MVC 4 web application for Servlet 3.0 environment
- Spring Data Redis
- Database (Redis, Redis To Go)  
- Thymeleaf templates with added Joda Time & Spring Security Dialects  
- Heroku fully cloud deployable
- Testing (JUnit/Mockito/MockMVC/AssertJ/Hamcrest)  
- Java 8, Spring Security 3.2, Maven 3, SLF4J, Logback, Bootstrap 3.3.4, jQuery 1.11.2, i18n, etc


### Local Deployment 
Load a local Redis database on port 6379.  Flush the database with index equal to 0.

```
$ mvn clean install  
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).  
 
The application can also be deployed by running the `Application.java` class.

### Deploying to Heroku  
<i>The following steps require that the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) has been installed locally and that a Heroku account has been created.</i>

Navigate to the project directory on the command line.

Before creating your Heroku application, make sure that there is a Git repository associated with the project.   
```
$ git status
```  

If a Git repository is not associated with the project, then create one before continuing. 

Create a new application on Heroku.  
```
$ heroku create
```

Rename your Heroku application if interested.  
``` 
$ heroku apps:rename new-name
```

Add a Redis database to your Heroku application with the Redis To Go add-on.
Note that your Heroku account must have a credit card attached in order to use free add-ons other than the PostgreSQL and MySQL add-ons.
```
$ heroku addons:create redistogo:nano  
```

Deploy project to Heroku.  
```
$ git push heroku master
```

Look at your application logs to see what is happening behind the scenes.  
```
$ heroku logs
```

If your application deploys without timing out then open it as follows. 
```
$ heroku open
```
